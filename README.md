# SSO_Counter

**Added April 25: Google Collaboratory version (file: SSOcounter-collaboratory.ipynb).

Determines if an ArcGIS Online org is using SSO and creates a tally from a supplied list of AGO URL prefixes. 

In the ColdFusion version of this script, you'll need to add a full path at about line 69. I run this script froma CF Developer edition server as needed, giving me full access to cffile, cfhttp, etc.

In the Python3 version of this script, place the Jupyter or .py file in any directory. In that directory, create a data folder for the input file datain.csv and the script-generated output dataout.txt.
